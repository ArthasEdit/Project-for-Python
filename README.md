# This project about top 20 richest people from 2010 to 2021!!!

Hello everyone! I'm really happy to see you in our final team project! Now I wanna share our final project theme and a little information about 'How we created it?'. So let's go!

Our team is the 5th team and we decided to make our final project about “The 20 Richest People in the World from 2010 to 2021”! One of the main reasons for this is that we can see that most of the richest people in the world are engaged in information technology, in a word, IT. For example, Carlos Slim, Bill Gates, Murk Zuckerberg and others.
We would not have been able to complete this final project without a database. It is well known that it is difficult to find a database in any direction that fully meets our needs. That’s why we created the Database ourselves, as planned, complete with our own requirements. we had gone through the first of the steps before us when we created the database, now we had to create graphic charts using the data we created correctly, and compare them with each other. We started to create our final project in a coordinated way, using the knowledge we learned during and outside the course, and I think our project did not turn out worse than others.
